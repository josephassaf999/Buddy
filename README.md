# Buddy

Buddy is a mobile app designed to connect dog owners with trusted local dog walkers and sitters, making it easier to schedule walks, manage bookings, and receive real-time updates. The app was developed using Flutter and Dart on Android Studio for the front end, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across devices. For its backend, Firebase was used to handle authentication, real-time data synchronization, and cloud storage, providing a reliable and scalable infrastructure for managing users and their pets.
